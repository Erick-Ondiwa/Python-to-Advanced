# The enumerate() function in Python is a built-in function that allows you to iterate over an
# iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) while also keeping track of the current index (
# position) in the iterable. It essentially adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an
# enumerate object, which can be used to iterate over both the index and the value at the same time.

# Syntax:
iterable = ""
enumerate(iterable, start=0)

# Parameters:
# iterable: The sequence (list, tuple, string, etc.) that you want to iterate over.
# start (optional): The starting index for the enumeration. By default, it starts from 0,
# but you can specify a different start index if needed.
# Return Value:
# The enumerate() function returns an enumerate object, which yields pairs of index and
# corresponding elements from the iterable.

# Example 1: Basic Usage of enumerate()
# Letâ€™s look at a simple example where we iterate over a list and print each item along with its
# index.

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(index, fruit)

# Here, the enumerate() function allows us to access both the index (0, 1, 2) and the
# corresponding value ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry') in a single iteration.

# Example 2: Changing the Start Index
# You can use the start parameter to change the starting index. For example, you can start
# counting from 1 instead of 0.

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits, start=1):
    print(index, fruit)

# In this case, the enumeration starts from 1 instead of 0.

# Example 3: Enumerating Over a String
# You can use enumerate() to iterate over individual characters of a string, along with their
# positions.

word = "hello"

for index, letter in enumerate(word):
    print(index, letter)

# This shows how enumerate() can be used with strings to keep track of the index of each character.

# Example 4: Using enumerate() with Lists in List Comprehensions
# You can use enumerate() within list comprehensions to build new lists based on both the index
# and the value of each element.

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]

# Create a list of strings indicating the position and the value
indexed_numbers = [f"Index {i}: {num}" for i, num in enumerate(numbers)]
print(indexed_numbers)

# Here, enumerate() helps us easily construct a list of strings that include both the index and
# the value.

# Example 5: Enumerating Over Multiple Lists
# You can combine enumerate() with zip() to iterate over multiple lists, while also keeping track
# of the index.

names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
scores = [85, 90, 95]

for i, (name, score) in enumerate(zip(names, scores), start=1):
    print(f"Student {i}: {name} scored {score}")

# In this example, enumerate() is used to track the student number, while zip() pairs the names
# and scores lists.

# Example 6: Enumerating a Tuple
# The enumerate() function works with any iterable, including tuples.

colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')

for index, color in enumerate(colors):
    print(f"Color {index}: {color}")

# Example 7: Modifying Items in a List Using enumerate()
# If you need to modify items in a list based on their index, enumerate() makes it easy to
# reference both the index and the value.

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]

# Increment every number at an odd index by 5
for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
    if i % 2 != 0:
        numbers[i] += 5

print(numbers)

# In this case, we used the index provided by enumerate() to modify only the items at odd indices.

# Example 8: Enumerate with a Dictionary
# Although enumerate() cannot be directly applied to a dictionary, you can still use it with
# dict.items() to enumerate both the keys and values of the dictionary.

person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}

for i, (key, value) in enumerate(person.items(), start=1):
    print(f"Pair {i}: {key} = {value}")

# Example 9: Flattening Enumerated List of Lists
# You can use enumerate() when you have a list of lists, and you need both the outer list index and
# the inner list index.

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

for i, row in enumerate(matrix):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
        print(f"Element at row {i}, col {j}: {val}")

# Example 10: Enumerating to Handle Errors
# You can use enumerate() to help with debugging by including the index in your error messages or
# logs.

items = [10, 'twenty', 30]

for i, item in enumerate(items):
    try:
        result = item + 1  # This will cause an error for the string 'twenty'
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Error at index {i}: {e}")

# This can be a helpful debugging technique when working with large datasets or lists with mixed
# data types.

# Conclusion:
# The enumerate() function is a powerful tool for looping through an iterable while keeping track
# of the index.
# It is useful when you need both the index and the element in loops, especially when modifying
# data or creating new collections based on indices.
# You can combine enumerate() with other functions like zip() or dict.items() to achieve more
# complex iteration tasks.
# The start parameter gives you control over where to begin the index, providing flexibility when
# working with enumerations.
